# My-Bikes-Factory
This project aims to create a user-friendly interface enabling bike selection (Mountain or Road). User picks a bike type, they can further customize it by specifying color, model, tire type, and suspension. Users can uniquely identify, update, save, or delete bikes via a console window. C# is used to code.
This console can serve as the first form of user interface in an application which processes data entered by the user to filter the options requested by the user.  

  



The Project is coded in  <h1>C#</h1> and Microsoft Visual Studio has been used as the IDE environment.  

  

***Project Layers -*** 



  

>Business Layer 

>UI Layer  

>Data Layer

  

  

Business Layer :  

`The Business Logic layer manages all the business rules, calculations and actual logic within your application that enables it to actually implement the functionalities and it may often use some of the objects retrieved from your data-access layer `

  



  

  

UI Layer : 

`The user interface layer in the entry point for the application. It interacts with the infrastructure. UI Layer is the User Interface Layer  `

  

  



Data Layer :

`Data Access Layers typically contain methods for accessing the underlying database data.  This allows the client (or user) modules to be created with a higher level of abstraction`

The functioning and importance of each layer (data, business, and UI layer) 

About the integration between the different layers  

The methods used to validate different buttons and fields 

How to serialize data and use XML Data to store and manipulate user data
