# My-Bikes-Factory
This project aims to create a user-friendly interface enabling bike selection (Mountain or Road). User picks a bike type, they can further customize it by specifying color, model, tire type, and suspension. Users can uniquely identify, update, save, or delete bikes via a console window. C# is used to code.
